# `react4xp`

Bundles all the necessary NPM components of [React4xp](https://market.enonic.com/vendors/enonic/react4xp-starter), so
that these packages don't need to be separately installed and version-handled:

- [react4xp-buildconstants](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react4xp-buildconstants)
- [react4xp-runtime-nashornpolyfills](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react4xp-runtime-nashornpolyfills)

Moved to it's own repository:

- [react4xp-regions](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react4xp-regions)

## Usage

**Not really intended for separate installation or use!**

Part of the [react4xp NPM bundle](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react4xp). Better start with
the [React4xp introduction](https://developer.enonic.com/templates/react4xp).
